**About me**

I am currently a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am advised by Prof. [Tajana Šimunić Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/) in the System Energy Efficiency Lab ([SEELab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/)). 
<br/><br/>
I am mainly interested in domain-specific acceleration and computer architecture. My research interests also includes fully homomorphic encryption and bioinformatics.
<br/><br/>
Prior to the doctorate program, I received my B.S. degree with double majors in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics from UCSD at 2023.
